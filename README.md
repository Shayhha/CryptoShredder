# CryptoShredder - Secure File Management Utility

CryptoShredder is a powerful tool designed to securely erase files, making data recovery virtually impossible. This application utilizes multiple passes and employs the Mersenne Twister random number generator to overwrite file contents with secure and random bytes. Developed in C++ with Qt framework, it features multi-threading for wiping multiple files and smart memory management for efficiency.

## Clone Repository:
