# CryptoShredder - Secure File Management Utility

CryptoShredder is a powerful tool designed for securely erasing files and encrypting/decrypting data. This application utilizes multiple passes to ensure thorough file erasure and employs AES encryption with key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits for robust data security. 

CryptoShredder has been developed using C++ in conjunction with the Qt framework, which provides a solid foundation for its functionality. It leverages multi-threading to efficiently wipe, encrypt and decrypt multiple files simultaneously, enhancing performance. Moreover, it incorporates smart memory management techniques to optimize resource utilization, ensuring efficient operation.
